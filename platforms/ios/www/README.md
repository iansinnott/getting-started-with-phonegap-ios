# Getting started with Phonegap

In short: 

1. `npm i -g phonegap`
2. `phonegap create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld`
3. `phonegap build ios`

To run the app in the iOS emulator: 

1. `phonegap run ios`

**Note:** The run command will do `build` for you, but if you don't want to instantly run the app in the simulator then use `build` separately.

#### The documentation for phonegap is seriously out of date, and it doesn't ever seem to distinguish between cordova and phonegap in a meaningful way.


The info on [this page][more_docs] is decent for getting started:
